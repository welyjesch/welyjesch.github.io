Wely is your average coder, geek, and aloof guy who wrote this silly collection of thoughts (deemed important or worth sharing).
He wishes that he can really do something mind-blowingly cool. Like save the world, maybe. Or Emma Watson. Haha. 
He codes in javascript, PHP, and more recently, python. He's currently busting his ass studying machine learning systems.
I'd like to add more but that's all I got for now.
