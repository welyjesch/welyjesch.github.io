Couldn't think of a better title than what the cat is doing outside the window.
Steadily cleaning up the coiling dragon gitbook. There are some weird gitbook templating issues. It turns out that it doesn't support all markdown formats.
Particularly with nested lists. It uses tabbed/spaces instead of multiple asterisks. Anyway, aside from that I'm looking into the machine learning course, which
would start later this month. For the meantime, I'm looking into the mit opencourseware for systems security. It's new (just last year), and it seems really 
interesting. I viewed the lectures just to hear some sys-ad "war stories" but I got hooked and decided to start at the beginning.
Anyway, I'm mostly preoccupied with chores so nothing much related to side projects for now.
