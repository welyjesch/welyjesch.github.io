A couple of weeks ago, I started studying machine learning. However, after checking out more recent projects / links from [fun iphone notebooks][pythonnotebooks], I had to update my ipython notebook package to use jupyter instead. The downside is, most of the packages I previously used (matplotlib, scipy, beautiful-soup) seems to have a bunch of problems. Through going through a lot of stackoverflow q&a. It turns out I just had to uninstall and reinstall my packages using jupyter's own package manager (anaconda's) pip installer.

Anyway, I went home to the province. Aside from reading and trying a bunch of data science walkthroughs/tutorials, I'm also catching up on a bunch of tv series, movies, and games that I had to forego during the time I had been utterly busy with work. Also, I'll be taking the actual coursera course for ML tomorrow. I'm still looking for a better internet service provider here so I could keep up with the course. After that, maybe renew my passport and go couchsurfing for the time being, maybe? meanwhile I'm looking at a more updated [machine learning repo][ml-repo].

Interesting [security case study][instagramcasestudy] by instagram, where different entry points (authentication) was exploited. This I believe, is also why we've focused on a central access control layer in my previous company. Another [interesting study][hipsterstudy] by a mathematician on why hipsters look / kinda stay the same. There's also some [tips and tricks][awsmistakes] from cloudonaut on managing your aws infra. And of course, a [really long discussion][stateofunion] about js and up & coming web trend/tech.
