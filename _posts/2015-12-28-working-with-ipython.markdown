A couple of weeks ago, I started studying machine learning. However, after checking out more recent projects / links from [fun iphone notebooks][pythonnotebooks], I had to update my ipython notebook package to use jupyter instead. The downside is, most of the packages I previously used (matplotlib, scipy, beautiful-soup) seems to have a bunch of problems. Through going through a lot of stackoverflow q&a. It turns out I just had to uninstall and reinstall my packages using jupyter's own package manager (anaconda's) pip installer.

Anyway, I went home to the province. Aside from reading and trying a bunch of data science walkthroughs/tutorials, I'm also catching up on a bunch of tv series, movies, and games that I had to forego during the time I had been utterly busy with work. Also, I'll be taking the actual coursera course for ML tomorrow. I'm still looking for a better internet service provider here so I could keep up with the course. After that, maybe renew my passport and go couchsurfing for the time being, maybe?
