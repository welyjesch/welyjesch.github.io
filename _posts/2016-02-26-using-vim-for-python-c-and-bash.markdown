A problem I had when working with algorithm online is my data limits. Anyway, I decided to solve these problems offline using mkdocs to store the problem details. I'll run them in codility in batches. 

I've been visiting the idp review center for ielts for the reference materials, however I found examples online so I'm mostly there just to get a feel of the exam environment. 

The past two months, I've also been brushing up on my linux fundamentals, although not on a regular/daily basis. bash scripting, linux commands (text processing, package management, configs). The LPIC (linux professional instute certification) reviewer helps a lot. As I've mentioned in the previous version of this post, I've customized a lot of configs. That being said, one of the major topics that came up is security (netstat, iptables, lsof -i, gpg and ssh). I think every software engineer working in linux should have a good grasp of these fundamentals, even if their job description doesn't really require it. Majority of the servers being deployed out in the wild uses linux/unix, and it would be an advantage when you work for a company using these. The reviewer doesn't go into details, although as always I've been looking through some related supplementary readings (practical applications)and read about intrusion detection systems, using central authentication service, and a variety of log analysis methods. but just thought-experimenting with these use-cases is not really satisfying.
