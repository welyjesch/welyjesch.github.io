So yeah, things are actually going well here. Now that I had the scraped data, the only thing I need to do was preparing them. I'm actually working on a few other side projects, like preparing the data for markdown templating. That is, every day I can scrape and publish to github pages my fave xianxia updates. I'll just have to host the scrapers in my DO box and run it in cron though lol. Anyway, it's back to lazy mode again. well not so lazy, since I'm spending afternoons at the gym. Which seems like a wasted effort since after the workout I'd get so hungry I wolf down twice the amount of calories I lose. But anyway, it helps with the cardio and the 'prediabetic' problem. That's it for now. Oh right, I had fun lately with python. I mean, hahaha. It's a whole new world here. I'm thinking of actually taking a certification course in coursera before finishing my visa requirements and getting a new job.
