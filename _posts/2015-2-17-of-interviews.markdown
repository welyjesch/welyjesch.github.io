So I had also been preparing for coding interviews lately. To be honest, this gives me the jitters since I'm not entirely confident of my stored knowledge when it comes to data structures, design patterns, etc. One of the ideas that I had before was to review for a certification exam first, to gain an edge in the industry as well as polishing my rusty memory in preparation for technical interviews. Early this year, I've been fortunate enough to have an initial interview with someone from a ycombinator company (eg startup). It went rather well, to be honest. But despite that, he told me to brushup on a few things. After chatting with a few people in IRC. lol. I was referred to a few resources. 

First of all, is the book "Cracking the coding interview". For practice coding, [leetcode][leetcode], [interviewbit][interviewbit] and [codility][codility]. Anyway, what's particularly cool about this, is remembering the bits and pieces I've learned during college, and the refreshing "TIL" feeling whenever I reached the epiphany / "trick" to finally reach the best case time complexity for a particular problem.Then for in depth understanding of computer science concepts and nuances (also includes interviews), https://www.geeksforgeeks.org.
