I mentioned earlier that I've been working on publishing to markdown a custom scraper I made for a xianxia novel, right?
Well, wasn't that just too fast? What really took me a long time is to sort out the chapter orders, since the normal alphabetical sorting
places 11 before 2. so yeah, I had to clean up the summary pages, as well. But for what it's worth. The outcome seems pretty sweet.
I can also export the published book as epub, so it's a double win for me, since I can already re-read this epic xianxia saga, whenever
I get bored during commute and stuff. Anyway, one thing at a time though. I've cleaned up my old stuff in my Analytics account.
It seems like my accounts/websites have accumulated over the years. hahaha

Anyway, you can check out the published book at [Gitbook][gitbook-link]. It consists of 21 books, with over 800 chapters. 
I still haven't individually cleaned each chapter but I'll be working on that the next time I get bored. lol. Been reading a bunch of python-related stuff,
that are just a bit frustrating since some are a bit old and exceptions one-after-another had been popping out (ipython notebook / jupyter sh*t). 
thankfully, I've been using vagrant (VMs) to reset the environment whenever things get too messed up.
