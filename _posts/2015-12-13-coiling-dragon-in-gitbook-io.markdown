I mentioned earlier that I've been working on publishing to markdown a custom scraper I made for a xianxia novel, right?
Well, wasn't that just too fast? What really took me a long time is to sort out the chapter orders, since the normal alphabetical sorting
places 11 before 2. so yeah, I had to clean up the summary pages, as well. But for what it's worth. The outcome seems pretty sweet.
I can also export the published book as epub, so it's a double win for me, since I can already re-read this epic xianxia saga, whenever
I get bored during commute and stuff. Anyway, one thing at a time though. I've cleaned up my old stuff in my Analytics account.
It seems like my accounts/websites have accumulated over the years. hahaha

Anyway, you can check out the gitbook page for coiling dragon at https://www.gitbook.com/book/welyjesch/coiling-dragon/details
